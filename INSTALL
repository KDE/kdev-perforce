To install simply follow these rules:

mkdir build
cd  build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<kdevplatformdir> -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<kdevplatformdir> ../
make 
make install

<kdevplatformdir> refers to the installation prefix of KDevPlatform. If you
installed KDevPlatform from your distribution packages I suggest to use
$HOME/kdevelop with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. This will allow to install the plugin
without polluting the system directory.  If you install outside of the
KDevPlatform directory you'll have to set the environment variable KDEDIRS to
include the installation directory of the plugin and run kbuildsycoca4 before
starting kdevelop from the same terminal.
