Requirements:
-------------

The perforce command line client found at: http://www.perforce.com/perforce/downloads/index.html

KDevPlatform, version 1.1.0 (which in turn means that
KDE Platform 4.4 or later needs to be installed too)

The plugin will require the P4CONFIG variable to be set because the perforce command line client will need it.
Typically the P4CONFIG variable is set to p4config.txt. It is the name of the file where the command line client will
read all configuration from.

The P4CONFIG file will typically be located in your workspace root.

For more information about P4CONFIG please refer to:
